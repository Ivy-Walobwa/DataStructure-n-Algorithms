# Selection Sort

A sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the smallest element (or largest) from the unsorted portion of a list and moves it to the sorted portion.

- Input - Unsorted list of elements

- Output -  Sorted list of elements

## Algorithm

1. Start from the first element and assume it is the minimum.
2. Repeat for each element in the list:
   1. Find the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion.
   2. Swap it with the first unsorted element.
3. Continue until the entire list is sorted.

Time Complexity: O($n^2$)
